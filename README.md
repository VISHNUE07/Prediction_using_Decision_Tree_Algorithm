# Decision Tree Classification - Iris Dataset
## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of an internship task with The Sparks Foundation. The goal was to implement a Decision Tree classifier using the Iris dataset. The project aimed to create a model that could classify iris flowers into their respective species and visualize the decision tree graphically. The classifier is designed to predict the correct class when fed with new data.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and contains 150 samples of iris flowers. Each sample belongs to one of three species:

* Iris-setosa
* Iris-versicolor
* Iris-virginica
  
## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to create a Decision Tree classifier based on the Iris dataset, visualize the tree structure graphically, and ensure that the classifier could accurately predict the species of iris flowers when presented with new data.

## Methodology
1. Data Preparation:
  * Loaded the Iris dataset and performed exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of features and classes.
  * Prepared the data by splitting it into training and testing sets.
2. Decision Tree Classifier:
  * Implemented the Decision Tree algorithm using Scikit-Learn.
  * Trained the classifier on the training data and evaluated its performance on the test data.
3. Model Visualization:
  * Visualized the decision tree graphically to show the structure of the model, including decision nodes and leaf nodes.
  * Used libraries like Tree and Matplotlib to render the tree for easy interpretation.
4. Prediction:
  * Tested the classifier with new data points to verify its ability to accurately predict the species of iris flowers.

## Results
* The Decision Tree classifier was successfully trained and was able to classify the iris species with high accuracy.
* The graphical visualization of the decision tree provides a clear understanding of how the model makes decisions based on the features of the dataset.
* The model is capable of predicting the correct class for new data inputs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas for data handling and manipulation
* Scikit-Learn for implementing the Decision Tree algorithm
* Tree and Matplotlib for visualizing the decision tree

## Conclusion
This project effectively demonstrates the use of the Decision Tree algorithm for classification tasks using the Iris dataset. The resulting model is both interpretable and accurate, making it a valuable tool for predicting the species of iris flowers when presented with new data.
